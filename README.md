simple-utf8-cpp
===============

Tiny simple library to convert between utf8 bytes and char32_t codepoints in C++.

Reference
---------

The decoder is based on statemachine approach:
https://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa.

Requirements
------------

No external dependencies except a compiler that supports at least C++17.

Example
-------

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "simple_utf8.h"

int main() {
  // Decoding
  std::string s("ä½ å¥½ä¸–ç•Œ, hello world! ðŸ˜Š");
  std::u32string p(simple_utf8::CountCodes(s), 0);
  auto n = simple_utf8::Decode(s, p);  // returns number of codepoints.
  for (auto codepoint : p) std::cout << codepoint << std::endl;

  // Encoding
  std::string s1(simple_utf8::CountBytes(p), 0);
  auto k = simple_utf8::Encode(p, s1);
  std::cout << s1 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Run tests
---------

```
cmake -B build -S .
make -C build tests
./build/tests/tests
```
