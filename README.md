simple-utf8-cpp
===============

Tiny simple library to convert between utf8 bytes and char32_t codepoints in C++.

Reference
---------

- The default decoder function `Decode` is based on statemachine approach: https://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa.
- I also implemented a naive approach decoder function: `DecodeNaive`, which seems to be a little faster. [benchmark](#benchmark).
- [rfc3629 - UTF-8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629)

Requirements
------------

No external dependencies except a compiler that supports at least C++17.

Example
-------

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "simple_utf8.h"

int main() {
  // Decoding via DFA
  std::string s("ä½ å¥½ä¸–ç•Œ, hello world! ðŸ˜Š");
  std::u32string p(simple_utf8::CountCodes(s), 0);
  auto n = simple_utf8::Decode(s, p);  // returns number of codepoints.
  for (auto codepoint : p) std::cout << codepoint << std::endl;

  // Decoding via naive approach.
  std::u32string p1(simple_utf8::CountCodes(s), 0);
  auto n1 = simple_utf8::DecodeNaive(s, p1);
  for (auto codepoint : p1) std::cout << codepoint << std::endl;

  // Encoding
  std::string s2(simple_utf8::CountBytes(p), 0);
  auto k = simple_utf8::Encode(p, s2);
  std::cout << s2 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Run tests
---------

```
cmake -B build -S . -DSIMPLE_UTF8_TEST=1
cmake --build build --target runtests
```

Benchmark
---------

How to run benchmark:

```
cmake -B build -S . -DSIMPLE_UTF8_TEST=1
cmake --build build --target runbenchmark
```
